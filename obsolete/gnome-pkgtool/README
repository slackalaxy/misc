NOTE!
This program is from 2004. I like to have it just for fun and I do use
it to browse my installed packages or view their contents, but I do not
run it as root and I would not rely on it for package install/uninstall.
Also, the option to build a packages from source does not work, as it
relied on good old checkinstall.

I don't know if it is safe to use anymore, so you've been warned! -Petar

This is a GTK+ front-end to the Slackware package management tools
(pkgtool). With gnome-pkgtool you can do the following actions to your
Slackware Linux installation:

- Install .t?z packages
- Uninstall installed packages
- Re-install/upgrade installed packages
- Inspect packages content

For its function, gnome-pkgtool relies on installpkg and removepkg
tools for installing and uninstalling packages.
