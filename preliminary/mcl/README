The MCL algorithm is short for the Markov Cluster Algorithm, a fast and
scalable unsupervised cluster algorithm for graphs (also known as
networks) based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs.

Natural clusters in a graph are characterised by the presence of many
edges between the members of that cluster, and one expects that the
number of higher-length (longer) paths between two arbitrary nodes in
the cluster is high. In particular, this number should be high, relative
to node pairs lying in different natural clusters. A different angle on
this is that random walks on the graph will infrequently go from one
natural cluster to another.

The MCL algorithm finds cluster structure in graphs by a mathematical
bootstrapping procedure. The process deterministically computes (the
probabilities of) random walks through the graph, and uses two operators
transforming one set of probabilities into another. It does so using the
language of stochastic matrices (also called Markov matrices) which
capture the mathematical concept of random walks on a graph.
